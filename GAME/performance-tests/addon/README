I. Introduction
--------------------
This performance test benchmarks a GME add-on. The following command
is used to execute the test:

  %> client --test=TEST [--progid=PROGID] [--iterations=N]

where:

  . TEST   - the event test to execute (e.g., OBJEVENT_CREATED)
  . PROGID - COM program id of the add-on [optional]
  . N      - number of iterations [default=10000, optional]

If you omit the --progid option, then this test will benchmark GME without
any add-on loaded. This can be used to compare the performance of GME with
and without an add-on. For example, the following commands will compare the
performance impact of GAME addon framework on GME's baseline:

  %> client --test=OBJEVENT_CREATED                             # baseline
  %> client --test=OBJEVENT_CREATED --progid=GAME.AddOn.Null    # w/ GAME

II. Addons
----------------
The following is a list of program ids for different add-ons that
can be used to benchmarks the performance of their framework:

    Framework  | PROGID
    ----------------------------------------------
    GAME       | GAME.AddOn.Null

III. Performance Tests
-------------------------
The following is a list of performance tests that are currently
supported by this client:

    Test                | Description
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    OBJEVENT_CREATED    | Evaluate performance related to creating an event
