Migrating Existing Models
------------------------------------------

Some changes to the abstrations in a GME metamodel can result 
in existing models not automatically updating to the new paradigm.
When this happens, it is necessary to migrate existing models
created using an old paradigm to the new paradigm. To assist
with the migration, CoSMIC provides a migration script, which
is a wrapper around Xalan-J. It is available at the following
location:

 %> $COSMIC_ROOT/bin/migrate.bat (for Windows)
 %> $COSMIC_ROOT/bin/migrate.sh  (for non-Windows)
  
The following are the command-line options, which must appear
in the exact order as specified:

 %> migrate INPUT OUTPUT XSLFILE
  
  INPUT   - The existing (or old) .xme file
  OUTPUT  - The resultant output file of the transformation
  XLSFILE - The .xsl/xslt transformation file

Most migration scripts for the different paradigms (or modeling
languages) are located in the ./migration directory for that
particular paradigm.
