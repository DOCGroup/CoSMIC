====================================================

. The Benchmark Data Collector (BDC) is now a service object
  that collects metrics and manages components registration
  The BDC notifies loaded services of events that occur
  in the environment that may be of interest. Services
  are loaded into the BDC using by setting the attribute
  service attribute as follows:

  <svc_name> <svc_path> <svc_args>;

  Mulitple services can be loaded by chaining series of
  the statment above as follows:

  <svc_name> <svc_path> <svc_args>;<svc_name> <svc_path> <svc_args>;

  We currently recommend that svc_name and svc_path do not
  have spaces in their name.

. The BDC does not explicitly provide a Path_Measurement
  receptacle type and is being transitioned into a service
  object for the BDC.

. There is no longer a Benchmark_Data_Collector_Ex (extended
  BDC for storing metrics into a database. Instead, it is
  a service object that is located in the shared library
  CUTS_Database_Service

. There is no attribute on the BDC for dumping metrics to
  an XML file. This is also being transitioned into a service
  object that's located in the shared library CUTS_XML.
