        * Utils/gme/Project.h:
        * Utils/gme/Project.cpp:
        
          The XML parser and dumper are no longer part of the project
          object. Instead they are standalone objects that operate
          on project objects.

        * Utils/gme/XML.h:
        * Utils/gme/XML.cpp:
        
          . Re-implemented the XML parser and dumper so they are 
            standalone objects that operate on project elements.
            
          . It is now possible to retrieve the XML information from
            an GME XML project file.

        * Utils/gme/Set.cpp:

          Implemented a new exception named 'Invalid_Cast ()', which
          is thrown when a _narrow () operation fails.

        * Utils/gme/RegistryNode.h:
        * Utils/gme/RegistryNode.cpp:
        
          Re-implemented the RegistryNodes collection as a 
          GME::Collection_T object.

        * Installer/RegisterParadigm/RegisterParadigm.cpp:
        * Installer/RegisterParadigm/RegisterParadigm.def:

          Added support for building GME 7.6.29 version of 
          the CoSMIC installer. A new environmental variable
          GME_VERSION is now required to build CoSMIC msi
          installer successfully.

        * PIM/PICML/paradigms/PICML.xmp:

          - Bug fix where the modeling of connections between Node,
            Interconnect, and Bridge elements prevented anyone from being
            able to model a network topology.

          - Change operatingSystem, configuration, and architecture
            macros from enum types to field types. This will allow users
            to entire any arbitrary value for the respective element.

        * ChangeLog:
        * ChangeLogs/ChangeLog-08a:

          Refreshed the current ChangeLog and save the ChangeLog for the

        * PIM/PICML/decorators/IDMLDecorators.cpp:
        * PIM/PICML/decorators/resource.h:

          Update the decorator to display supported interfaces as ports
          on the parent component.

        * PIM/PICML/interpreters/DeploymentPlan/DeploymentPlanVisitor.cpp:
        * PIM/PICML/interpreters/PAM/PAMVisitor.h:
        * PIM/PICML/interpreters/Package/PackageVisitor.cpp:
        * PIM/PICML/interpreters/Path/PathVisitor.cpp:

          Update the implemenation to handle the new addition for the
          creating connections to supported interfaces at the assembly
          level. I just casted the object instead of creating implementation
          to handle such cases.

        * PIM/PICML/paradigms/PICMLParadigm.wxs:

          Added the missing CBML images to the installer.

        * PIM/PICML/paradigms/icons/object.bmp:

          Change the color of the cloud from white to gray since it was
          causing the decorator to treat the white in the cloud as
          the transparent color.

        * Utils/gme/Folder_Model_T.cpp:
        * Utils/gme/Reference.cpp:
        * Utils/gme/Set.cpp:

          Bug fix where using a previously released object would cause
          an assertion failure because the target reference was not
          nil. The middleware, therefore, assumed the object was not
          properly released (or ref counted).

        * Utils/gme/Collection_T.h:
        * Utils/gme/Collection_T.inl:

          Aggregated the methods to the actual container object. This
          makes it a LOT easier to use the collection object becuase
          you do not have to use the items () method to access the
          container's properties.

        * Utils/gme/FCO.cpp:

        * Utils/gme/Object.cpp:
        * Utils/gme/Set.cpp:

          Updated the usage of the collection object based on the
          change above.

        * PIM/PICML/interpreters/PackageComponent/PackageComponent.mpc:

          Fixed build errors related to disabling zlib at the workspace
          level. The PackageComponent project would still exist even though
          the Package project was not present becuase zlib=0. If Package[d].lib
          was not previously built, then the solution build would fail.

        * MPC/config/wix.mpb:

          Changed the 'source_outputext' to 'generic_outputext'.

          Base projects for using various extension in Wix.

        * cosmic_ace.mwc:

          Bug fix where generate workspace had duplicate project
          names.

          of GME projects.
