          Removed the constraint for ensuring that a composite action
          had only 1 InputAction element since component actions are
          no longer supported at this time.

          Although the previous update to PICML was valid, UDM did not
          like it. :-( It had problems resolving the association between
          MultiInput, QueryInput, Input. To resolve this problem, MultiInput
          connections connect to MultiInputAction element. This does break
          existing models, however, we have created an .xslt script to
          migrate old models.

          To apply the transformation script, use Model Migrate, which
          is provide with GME. Or, import the old model using GME and
          locate InputAction_to_MultiInputAction.xsl as the tranformation
          script to apply on the model.

          . Completed support for modelig query-based actions. Query-based
            actions are modeled by connecting a query input action to the

        * PIM/PICML/paradigms/icons/QueryAction.bmp:

          . Implemented support for query-based actions. A query action
            is one that tests a specified input port for an event. This
            is similar to how event-based systems and architectures,
            such as DDS and Apollo, operate. Query actions have the same
            modeling semantics as regular actions.

        * Installer/CoSMIC_Installer/CoSMIC_common.wxs:
        * Installer/CoSMIC_Installer/EnvironmentVars.wxi:

          . The installer now requires definition of the
            XERCESC_VERSION environment variable. This is used to select
            the correct version of Xerces-C for the installer.

        * PIM/PICML/interpreters/IDLGenerator/IDLGenerator.wxs:

          . The 6.11.9 version of the IDL generator only works in debug
            mode. Added preprocessor statements to select the correct
            version of the binary for the installer.

        * Utils/gme/Project.cpp:

          . Implemented paradigm_name (), which returns the paradigm name
            for the project.

          . Implemented paradigm_version (), which returns the paradigm
            version of the project.

          utilities project.

        * Utils/gme/Object.cpp:
        * Utils/gme/XML.cpp:

          Bug fix where if any of the output parameters of the XML

          on project objects.

        * Utils/gme/XML.h:
        * Utils/gme/XML.cpp:

          . Re-implemented the XML parser and dumper so they are
            standalone objects that operate on project elements.

          . It is now possible to retrieve the XML information from
            an GME XML project file.

          Added support for building GME 7.6.29 version of

          GME_VERSION is now required to build CoSMIC msi

          - Bug fix where the modeling of connections between Node,
            Interconnect, and Bridge elements prevented anyone from being
            able to model a network topology.

          - Change operatingSystem, configuration, and architecture
            macros from enum types to field types. This will allow users
            to entire any arbitrary value for the respective element.

          Update the implemenation to handle the new addition for the
          creating connections to supported interfaces at the assembly
          level. I just casted the object instead of creating implementation
          to handle such cases.

        * PIM/PICML/paradigms/PICMLParadigm.wxs:

          Added the missing CBML images to the installer.

        * PIM/PICML/paradigms/icons/object.bmp:

          Change the color of the cloud from white to gray since it was
          causing the decorator to treat the white in the cloud as
          the transparent color.

          Bug fix where using a previously released object would cause
          an assertion failure because the target reference was not
          nil. The middleware, therefore, assumed the object was not
          properly released (or ref counted).

        * Utils/gme/Collection_T.h:
        * Utils/gme/Collection_T.inl:

          Aggregated the methods to the actual container object. This
          makes it a LOT easier to use the collection object becuase
          you do not have to use the items () method to access the

        * PIM/PICML/interpreters/PackageComponent/PackageComponent.mpc:

          Fixed build errors related to disabling zlib at the workspace
          level. The PackageComponent project would still exist even though
          the Package project was not present becuase zlib=0. If Package[d].lib
          was not previously built, then the solution build would fail.
