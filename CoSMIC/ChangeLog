        * PIM/PICML/addons/PICMLManager/DefaultImplementationGenerator.cpp:
        * PIM/PICML/addons/PICMLManager/RawComponent.cpp:

          . Bug fix where using the default implementation generator
            to generate an existing component's implementation did
            not set the component reference for the monolithic
            implementation.

          . Bug fix where adding a component instance to a component
            assembly resulted in generating the default implementation
            for the newly created instance. This should happen only
            when adding a component to a interface definition.
