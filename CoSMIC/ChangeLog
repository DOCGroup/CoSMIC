        * PIM/PICML/addons/PICMLManager/RawComponent.h:
        * PIM/PICML/addons/PICMLManager/RawComponent.cpp:

          . Bug fix where importing an XML document caused the add-on to
            generate an unwanted collocation group. This was fixed by
            disabling this part of the handler/add-on during imports.

          . Whenever the user is selecting components for a collocation
            group, the add-on will ensure that the active component is not
            deployed on any other node. This is handled by removing the
            component from all the other collocation groups.

        * Utils/gme/FCO.h:
        * Utils/gme/FCO.cpp:

          A default collocation group is generated for a node whenever a
          new node reference is added to the deployment plan. This should
          help reduce the effort in creating a deployment plan.

          Moved all the QED interepters to the arch/QED directory. Since we
          are starting to use PICML to generate metadata for different
          architectures/technologies, we need a directories to hold interpreters
          specific to a particular architecture. Eventually, we will be creating
          a CCM directory for all the CCM-speficic interpreters.

          . Disabled the name for the following elements: DoWhileState,
            WhileState, PeriodicEvent, and ApplicationTask.

          . Added a new modeling element named ApplicationTask, which
            is used to create a separate thread of control at the
            application level. It has the same modeling semantics as
            all SingleInput elements, such as PeriodicEvent and
            InEventPort.

          . Variables now have an attribute named InitialValue, which
            is used to initial the variable at construction time.

          . Condition attributes in a BranchTransition are now a single
            line, instead of two lines. This helps with ensuring the
            condition doesn't have any uncessary line breaks.

          should NOT be included in the standard CoSMIC release.

Wed Jun 11 15:18:24 UTC 2008  James H. Hill  <hillj@isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * Utils/Utils.h:

          Fixed the include specification for the export header file.

        * Installer/CoSMIC_Installer/CoSMIC_Installer.wxs:
          Updated install condition message with GME version.

Sat Jun  7 00:17:16 UTC 2008  Sumant Tambe  <sutambe@nospam>

        * Utils/Utils.wxs:
          Debug version of Utils is added to the CoSMIC installer
          only for GME 6.11.9.

          Examples to test MTTVar and Specialize paradigms. These
          examples are communication dialog specialization, and
          genertion of configuration from requirements specification
          of a component-based application. The second example has
          been simplified from the QUICKER examples, though a PICML
          to CQML transformation will also work.

Wed Jun  4 23:45:54 UTC 2008  Amogh Kavimandan  <amoghk@nospam>

        * Transformations/MTTVar/paradigms/Specialize.xme:

          The second higher-order transformation that generates
          specialized instances of templatized transformation from
          VarML initially created using MTTVar paradigm.

        Fixed XERCESC path from lib to bin.

        * PIM/PICML/interpreters/IDLGenerator/IDLGenerator.wxs:

          The installer will install the debug version of the IDL generator
          for GME 6.11.9 and the release version of GME 7.x.x.

        * PIM/PICML/paradigms/PICML.xme:
        * PIM/PICML/paradigms/PICML.xmp:

          Removed the constraint for ensuring that a composite action
          had only 1 InputAction element since component actions are
          no longer supported at this time.

          Although the previous update to PICML was valid, UDM did not
          like it. :-( It had problems resolving the association between
          MultiInput, QueryInput, Input. To resolve this problem, MultiInput
          connections connect to MultiInputAction element. This does break
          existing models, however, we have created an .xslt script to
          migrate old models.

          To apply the transformation script, use Model Migrate, which
          is provide with GME. Or, import the old model using GME and
          locate InputAction_to_MultiInputAction.xsl as the tranformation
          script to apply on the model.

          . Completed support for modelig query-based actions. Query-based
            actions are modeled by connecting a query input action to the
            desired input port and using query actions in the workload.

        * PIM/PICML/paradigms/icons/QueryAction.bmp:

          . Implemented support for query-based actions. A query action
            is one that tests a specified input port for an event. This
            is similar to how event-based systems and architectures,
            such as DDS and Apollo, operate. Query actions have the same
            modeling semantics as regular actions.

        * Installer/CoSMIC_Installer/CoSMIC_common.wxs:
        * Installer/CoSMIC_Installer/EnvironmentVars.wxi:

          . The installer now requires definition of the
            XERCESC_VERSION environment variable. This is used to select
            the correct version of Xerces-C for the installer.

        * PIM/PICML/interpreters/IDLGenerator/IDLGenerator.wxs:

          . The 6.11.9 version of the IDL generator only works in debug
            mode. Added preprocessor statements to select the correct
            version of the binary for the installer.

        * Utils/gme/Project.h:
        * Utils/gme/Project.cpp:

          . Implemented paradigm_name (), which returns the paradigm name
            for the project.

          . Implemented paradigm_version (), which returns the paradigm
            version of the project.

          utilities project.

        * Utils/gme/Object.cpp:
        * Utils/gme/XML.cpp:

          Bug fix where if any of the output parameters of the XML
          info were not defined, then it would cause a segementation
          fault.

        * Utils/gme/Project.h:

          The XML parser and dumper are no longer part of the project
          object. Instead they are standalone objects that operate
          on project objects.

        * Utils/gme/XML.h:
        * Utils/gme/XML.cpp:

          . Re-implemented the XML parser and dumper so they are
            standalone objects that operate on project elements.

          . It is now possible to retrieve the XML information from
            an GME XML project file.

          Added support for building GME 7.6.29 version of

          - Bug fix where the modeling of connections between Node,
            Interconnect, and Bridge elements prevented anyone from being
            able to model a network topology.

          - Change operatingSystem, configuration, and architecture
            macros from enum types to field types. This will allow users
            to entire any arbitrary value for the respective element.

          Update the implemenation to handle the new addition for the
          creating connections to supported interfaces at the assembly
          level. I just casted the object instead of creating implementation
          to handle such cases.

        * PIM/PICML/paradigms/PICMLParadigm.wxs:

          Added the missing CBML images to the installer.

        * PIM/PICML/paradigms/icons/object.bmp:

          Change the color of the cloud from white to gray since it was
          causing the decorator to treat the white in the cloud as
          the transparent color.

        * Utils/gme/Folder_Model_T.cpp:
        * Utils/gme/Reference.cpp:
        * Utils/gme/Set.cpp:

          Bug fix where using a previously released object would cause
          an assertion failure because the target reference was not
          nil. The middleware, therefore, assumed the object was not
          properly released (or ref counted).

        * Utils/gme/Collection_T.h:
        * Utils/gme/Collection_T.inl:

          Aggregated the methods to the actual container object. This
          makes it a LOT easier to use the collection object becuase
          you do not have to use the items () method to access the
          container's properties.

        * PIM/PICML/interpreters/PackageComponent/PackageComponent.mpc:

          Fixed build errors related to disabling zlib at the workspace
          level. The PackageComponent project would still exist even though
          the Package project was not present becuase zlib=0. If Package[d].lib
          was not previously built, then the solution build would fail.
