USER VISIBLE CHANGES BETWEEN CoSMIC-0.7.4.5 and CoSMIC-0.7.7
============================================================

. Re-enable the model intelligence feature that auto-generates
  default artifacts when a new Component is added to an
  File model element.

. When a user adds a new Component to the model, they can
  rename the component and set the suffix of the implementation
  and servant artifact.

. Implmented an IDL text editor, which allows end-users to
  write IDL instead of modeling it. When the user saves the
  file, it is serialized back into the model. It an be accessed
  using the following steps:

    1. Right click on File in tree view
    2. Select Interpret
    3. Select IDLTextEditor in listing

USER VISIBLE CHANGES BETWEEN CoSMIC-0.7.4 and CoSMIC-0.7.4.5
============================================================

. Disabled the model intelligence feature that auto-generates
  the default artifacts when a new component is added to the
  model.

. LEESA ships with a new Perl script called gen-pairs.pl that
  extends Udm generated header file with additional meta-information
  (IsDescendant and VisitorAsIndex) to speed up compilation.

USER VISIBLE CHANGES BETWEEN CoSMIC-0.7.3 and CoSMIC-0.7.4
==========================================================

. CoSMIC supports ACE/TAO/CIAO 0.7.4

. Improved PICML to better support CIAO/DAnCE 0.7.3.

. Entry points for a component implementation are no longer
  defined on an ImplementationArtifact element. Now, entry
  points are defined on the ComponentExecutorArtifact or
  ComponentServantArtifact that is attached to MonolithicImplementation
  element.

. Implemented a new interpreter named ComponentImplementationGenerator
  that will generate the default implementation and artifacts
  for an existing component in the interface definitions. This
  interpreter can be accessed via the interpreter dialog box
  (i.e., File | Run Interpreter...)

. The deployment plan interpreter now inserts plan locality
  information in the generated deployment plan.

. LEESA comes with a new StateMachine (SM) paradigm and its
  corresponding interpreter have been added to show how to use
  LEESA in a UDM-based project. Documentation of LEESA has also
  been enhanced.

. IDL_TO_PICML is more robust and faster than before.
   . Support for the MCPP preprocessor has been added to
     IDL_TO_PICML.

   . It now uses fully scoped names when generating a component
     implementation and its default artifacts to avoid name
     clashes.

   . Bug fix: idl_to_picml now uses fully scoped names when generating
     a component implementation and its default artifacts to avoid
     name clashes.

   . Bug fix: Under certain unknown circumstances, idl_to_picml failed
     to generate UUIDs on the necessary modeling elements.

   . Bug fix: A memory deletion problem associated with XMLString::transcode
     has been fixed.

   . Bug fix (3740): A problem of raising an unknown exception when -i
     command-line option is specified has been fixed.

   . Bug fix (3742): Front end of idl_to_picml now handles upto 1024
     .idl files at the command-line.
