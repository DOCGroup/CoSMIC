USER VISIBLE CHANGES BETWEEN CoSMIC-0.7.9 and CoSMIC-0.8.9
============================================================

. Added support for complex types, i.e., structures and sequences,
  to configuration properties in the deployment plan. This caused
  the metamodel to change and break existing models. Please use
  the latest migration script at the following location in the
  PICML paradigm directory to convert existing models.

. Implemented Beta version of the Property Manager, which is an
  interperter for manipulating property values. Currently, the
  Property Manager supports basic types, structures, structures
  of structure, sequences, and sequences of structs. When dealing
  with sequences, the Property Manager can only added elements
  to the sequence. It is not able to remove elements, or move
  elements to new locations.

. Implemented deprecation support to the DataType element and
  the DataValue attribute on a Property. This will be removed
  completely in the next release.

USER VISIBLE CHANGES BETWEEN CoSMIC-0.7.8 and CoSMIC-0.7.9
============================================================

. Added support IDL3+. This included adding support for template
  modules, port types, extended ports, mirror ports, and
  connectors to the InterfaceDefinitions aspect.

. Added support for modeling and deploying different implementations
  of a component. This resulted in changing how to model component
  instances in an assembly. This will also require you to migrate
  existing models to the lastest version of PICML.

  Please see the StockQuoter example at the following location for
  how to use the new version of PICML:

    http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/DOC_ROOT/CIAO/tutorials/Quoter/Simple/03.html

  In addition, please see the MIGRATION file in the ./docs for
  information on migrating existing models.

. Upgraded to the latest version of GME. We will no longer support
  muliple versions of GME at this time. Instead, we will only support
  the latest version of GME.

. The deployment plan interpreter now generates a supplemental .cdd
  file for each deployment it generates. If a property of type String
  with the following name is attached to a NodeReference:

    . StringIOR
    . CORBAName

  then the deployment plan interpreter will add the corresponding
  properties for that node to the generated .ccd file.

. The default component implementation generator has been added
  to the interpreter toolbar.

USER VISIBLE CHANGES BETWEEN CoSMIC-0.7.7 and CoSMIC-0.7.8
============================================================

. Enum type property values are supported.

. External ports are now defined as an Atom instead of
  as a Reference.

. Location of the external port can not be empty.

. Multiple ports connected to the same external port must of
  the same kind and object type.

. LEESA has been moved to its own repository. Please visit
  http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/LEESA

USER VISIBLE CHANGES BETWEEN CoSMIC-0.7.4.5 and CoSMIC-0.7.7
============================================================

. Re-enable the model intelligence feature that auto-generates
  default artifacts when a new Component is added to an
  File model element.

. When a user adds a new Component to the model, they can
  rename the component and set the suffix of the implementation
  and servant artifact.

. Implmented an IDL text editor, which allows end-users to
  write IDL instead of modeling it. When the user saves the
  file, it is serialized back into the model. It an be accessed
  using the following steps:

    1. Right click on File in tree view
    2. Select Interpret
    3. Select IDLTextEditor in listing

USER VISIBLE CHANGES BETWEEN CoSMIC-0.7.4 and CoSMIC-0.7.4.5
============================================================

. Disabled the model intelligence feature that auto-generates
  the default artifacts when a new component is added to the
  model.

. LEESA ships with a new Perl script called gen-pairs.pl that
  extends Udm generated header file with additional meta-information
  (IsDescendant and VisitorAsIndex) to speed up compilation.

USER VISIBLE CHANGES BETWEEN CoSMIC-0.7.3 and CoSMIC-0.7.4
==========================================================

. CoSMIC supports ACE/TAO/CIAO 0.7.4

. Improved PICML to better support CIAO/DAnCE 0.7.3.

. Entry points for a component implementation are no longer
  defined on an ImplementationArtifact element. Now, entry
  points are defined on the ComponentExecutorArtifact or
  ComponentServantArtifact that is attached to MonolithicImplementation
  element.

. Implemented a new interpreter named ComponentImplementationGenerator
  that will generate the default implementation and artifacts
  for an existing component in the interface definitions. This
  interpreter can be accessed via the interpreter dialog box
  (i.e., File | Run Interpreter...)

. The deployment plan interpreter now inserts plan locality
  information in the generated deployment plan.

. LEESA comes with a new StateMachine (SM) paradigm and its
  corresponding interpreter have been added to show how to use
  LEESA in a UDM-based project. Documentation of LEESA has also
  been enhanced.

. IDL_TO_PICML is more robust and faster than before.
   . Support for the MCPP preprocessor has been added to
     IDL_TO_PICML.

   . It now uses fully scoped names when generating a component
     implementation and its default artifacts to avoid name
     clashes.

   . Bug fix: idl_to_picml now uses fully scoped names when generating
     a component implementation and its default artifacts to avoid
     name clashes.

   . Bug fix: Under certain unknown circumstances, idl_to_picml failed
     to generate UUIDs on the necessary modeling elements.

   . Bug fix: A memory deletion problem associated with XMLString::transcode
     has been fixed.

   . Bug fix (3740): A problem of raising an unknown exception when -i
     command-line option is specified has been fixed.

   . Bug fix (3742): Front end of idl_to_picml now handles upto 1024
     .idl files at the command-line.
