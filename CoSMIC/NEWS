USER VISIBLE CHANGES BETWEEN CoSMIC-0.7.3 and CoSMIC-0.7.4
==========================================================

. CoSMIC supports ACE/TAO/CIAO 0.7.4
. Improved PICML to better support CIAO/DAnCE 0.7.3. 
. Entry points for a component implementation are no longer defined on an ImplementationArtifact 
  element. Now, entry points are defined on the ComponentExecutorArtifact or ComponentServantArtifact 
  that is attached to MonolithicImplementation element. 
. Implemented a new interpreter named ComponentImplementationGenerator that will 
  generate the default implementation and artifacts for an existing component in 
  the interface definitions. This interpreter can be accessed via the interpreter 
  dialog box (i.e., File | Run Interpreter...)
. The deployment plan interpreter now inserts plan locality information in the generated 
  deployment plan. 
. LEESA comes with a new StateMachine (SM) paradigm and its corresponding interpreter have been 
  added to show how to use LEESA in a UDM-based project. Documentation of LEESA has also been enhanced.
. IDL_TO_PICML is more robust and faster than before. 
   . Support for the MCPP preprocessor has been added to IDL_TO_PICML. 
   . It now uses fully scoped names when generating a component implementation and its default 
     artifacts to avoid name clashes. 
   . Bug fix: idl_to_picml now uses fully scoped names when generating a component implementation 
     and its default artifacts to avoid name clashes.
   . Bug fix: Under certain unknown circumstances, idl_to_picml failed to generate UUIDs on the 
     necessary modeling elements.
   . Bug fix: A memory deletion problem associated with XMLString::transcode has been fixed.
   . Bug fix (3740): A problem of raising an unknown exception when -i command-line option is 
     specified has been fixed.
   . Bug fix (3742): Front end of idl_to_picml now handles upto 1024 .idl files at the command-line.
