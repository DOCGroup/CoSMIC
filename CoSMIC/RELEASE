
This file documents the CoSMIC release procedure

1. Obtain a summary of the enhancements and respective contact information.
   Update the RELEASE-NOTES, README files.

2. Obtain a summary of user-visible changes and update the NEWS file.

3. Update the CoSMIC release version in the following files in the CoSMIC 
   repo.
   
   $(COSMIC_ROOT)/VERSION
   $(COSMIC_ROOT)/NEWS
   $(COSMIC_ROOT)/RELEASE-NOTES
   $(COSMIC_ROOT)/README
   $(COSMIC_ROOT)/Installer/CoSMIC_Installer/CoSMIC_Installer.wxs

4. This is a TEMPORARY step. It must reverted as soon as a tag is 
   created. Update the svn:externals properties of $(COSMIC_ROOT)/contrib 
   directory with the latest revision that is being used. This is done 
   using -r ##### at the beginning of each svn URL set in the svn:externals 
   property. For example, update the property that looks like below
   
   svn://svn.dre.vanderbilt.edu/DOC/Middleware/old-contrib/CCF CCF
   svn://svn.dre.vanderbilt.edu/DOC/Middleware/old-contrib/utility utility

   TO
   
   -r ##### svn://svn.dre.vanderbilt.edu/DOC/Middleware/old-contrib/CCF CCF
   -r ##### svn://svn.dre.vanderbilt.edu/DOC/Middleware/old-contrib/utility utility
   
   where ##### is the revision number of CCF and utility at the time of making 
   CoSMIC release.
   
   After tagging, remeber to bring the svn:externals property back to how it 
   was earlier. This will ensure that the latest and greatest changes from 
   the external repositories are obtained everytime you update. The purpose
   of this temporary update is to peg the revision number in the release tag.

5. Update the ChangeLog. For example, in $(COSMIC_ROOT) run the following 
   command.

   cle.pl ChangeLog "PQR XYZ" XYZ@nospam

   In the ChangeLog mention the revision of the external repositories being 
   used. For example,
   
   CCF -r ##### svn://svn.dre.vanderbilt.edu/DOC/Middleware/old-contrib/CCF
   utility -r ##### svn://svn.dre.vanderbilt.edu/DOC/Middleware/old-contrib/utility

6. Commit the modified files:  CoSMIC_Installer.wxs, NEWS, README, 
   RELEASE-NOTES, VERSION, and ChangeLog.
 
7. Build the CoSMIC installers. At the time of this writing, CoSMIC was 
   built using both GME 7.6.29 (vc8) and GME 9.8.28 (vc9) on equus and 
   trian nightly build machines respectively. Check the CoSMIC scoreboard
   at http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/scoreboard/cosmic.html to make sure
   they build properly. Upload the installers in the WWW repository as 
   described in step #12
   
8. Create a tag. For example,

   svn cp https://svn.dre.vanderbilt.edu/CoSMIC/trunk 
          https://svn.dre.vanderbilt.edu/CoSMIC/tags/CoSMIC-0.7.4 
          -m "Tagging for CoSMIC release 0.7.4" 

9. Bring the svn:externals property back to the HEAD revision. Remove 
   any -r ##### from the property.
         
10. Prepare a fresh ChangeLog file to be used after the release. Move the 
    existing ChangeLog file to ChangeLogs/ChangeLog-##. Fresh ChangeLog file 
    looks like the one below.
   
   Mon Oct 19 23:07:02 UTC 2009  PQR XYZ  <XYZ@nospam>
   
      * ChangeLog:
      * ChangeLogs/ChangeLog-09:
      * contrib

      . CoSMIC version 0.7.4 was released. Moved the ChangeLog 
        to ChangeLogs/ChangeLog-09. Reverted contrib svn:externals property 
        back to the HEAD revision.

   Local Variables:
   mode: change-log
   add-log-time-format: (lambda () (progn (setq tz (getenv "TZ")) (set-time-zone-rule "UTC") (setq time (format-time-string "%a %b %e %H:%M:%S %Z %Y" (current-time))) (set-time-zone-rule tz) time))
   indent-tabs-mode: nil
   End:

11. Commit the changes to the ChangeLog and svn:externals back in the repo.
