README

This document contains instructions on how to build the CoSMIC 
installer. The installer is built using WiX and the XML documents
that are needed by WiX are generated by MPC. To build the installer
please execute the following commands:

%> mwc.pl -type vc9 -features register=0 CoSMIC_Release_Build.mwc
%> devenv /useenv CoSMIC_Release_Build.sln
%> [build the release configuration]

%> mwc.pl -type wix CoSMIC_Release_Build.mwc
%> mwc.pl -type vc9 CoSMIC_Installer.mwc
%> devenv /useenv CoSMIC_Installer.sln
%> [build the release configuration]

The final build process will result in a file named CoSMIC_MSI.msi,
which is the installer application for CoSMIC.
