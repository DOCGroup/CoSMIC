This document is a roadmap for CoSMIC. It lists user visible
features that will be added to CoSMIC for each upcoming version.
This document can therefore help to better plan your CoSMIC usage,
as well as help us better plan for what features should be included
in each upcoming version of CoSMIC, depending on the amout of
effort required to complete the given feature.

USER VISIBLE CHANGES FOR CoSMIC-0.8.1
===========================================================

. Delegation of extended/mirror ports

. Support for generating valid descriptor information for
  AMI4CCM connections.

. Support process/thread specification for plan locality
  managers.

. Support specification of CPU or CPU core affinity for each
  process/thread.

. Complete support for managing ComplexType elements via the
  Property Manager, and expose the Property Manager icon on
  the toolbar.

. Generation of a nodemap.dat file in conjunction with the
  auto-generated .cdd file. The name of the file will the
  tranditional nodemap.dat file will be the same name as the
  deployment plan.

. When making a connection between a Facet/Receptacle and
  Connector, have the PICML Model Intelligence either (1)
  auto-complete the connection name or (2) display a dialog
  for selecting the correct connection name.

USER VISIBLE CHANGES FOR CoSMIC-0.8.2
===========================================================

. Placement of Property elements in their own aspect when
  viewing a ComponentAssembly to reduce *clutter*.

. Introduction of SimpleProperty and ComplexProperty model
  elements where SimpleProperty will be used for setting the
  values of PredefinedType and Enum elements, and ComplexProperty
  will be use to set the values for Aggregate, SwitchedAggregate,
  and Collection elements.

. Expansion of TemplateModule elements into their concrete
  artifacts. This will make it easier to determine the actual
  type of a parameter. Likewise, you can then use the concrete
  types like *traditional* elements.
