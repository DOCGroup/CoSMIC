/**
 *
 * This simplistic sample illustrates how an XML application can use
 * the SAX entityResolver handler to provide customized handling for
 * external entities.
 *
 * It registers an entity resolver with the parser. When ever the parser
 * comes across an external entity, like a reference to an external DTD
 * file, it calls the 'resolveEntity()' callback. This callback in this
 * sample checks to see if the external entity to be resolved is the file
 * 'personal.dtd'.
 *
 * If it is then, it redirects the input stream to the file 'redirect.dtd',
 * which is then read instead of 'personal.dtd'.
 *
 * If the external entity to be resolved was not the file 'personal.dtd', the
 * callback returns NULL indicating that do the default behaviour which is
 * to read the contents of 'personal.dtd'.
