        * PICML/paradigms/IDML-Meta.xme:
        * PICML/paradigms/IDML.mga:
        * PICML/paradigms/IDML.xmp:

          Added new meta-model of Interface Definition Modeling Language
          (IDML).


        * PICML/paradigms/PICML.mga:
        * PICML/paradigms/PICML.xmp:

          Added binary mga files and XML exported paradigm so that users
          need not run the interpreter on the PICML meta-model. This file
          can just be registered using File->Register Paradigms, so that
          one can use the paradigm to make models without dealing with the
          complex steps involving aspect mapping.

        * PICML/paradigms/PICML.xme:

          Updated to reflect icons, changes in IDML and some minor changes
          in the connections.
