        * IDML/*:
        * IDML/paradigms/IDML-Meta.xme:
        * IDML/paradigms/IDML.xmp:
        * IDML/paradimgs/Icons/*.bmp:

          Moved all the IDML files to their own directory. Also
          made minor changes to constraints and turned off name
          display on a couple of icons.
          
        * IDML/examples/new_test.xme:
        
          Example model.

        * IDML/paradigms/Icons/id.bmp:
        * IDML/paradigms/Icons/version.bmp:
        
          Removed these icons - no longer used.
          
        * IDML/paradigms/Icons/getexception.bmp:
        * IDML/paradigms/Icons/setexception.bmp:
        
          Swapped these, they had been saved to the wrong file.

        * PICML/paradifms/IDML-Meta.xme:
        * PICML/paradigms/IDML.xmp:
        
          Turned off the name display of some metamodel elememts, so that
          the name is hidden when dragged into the model editor. This
          change is to make things less confusing for the user, since now
          all the names that are not used by the IDL generator interpreter
          (in progress) and not checked by the GME constraint manager are
          not displayed for the user to worry about or try to edit. Also
          created some new metamodel elements which are twins of the
          various elements for the various anonymous types and also for
          the named type reference element. These new elements use the
          same icons as their twins, but their name display is turned
          off as explained above.

        * PICML/paradifms/IDML-Meta.xme:
        * PICML/paradigms/IDML.xmp:
        
          Made some minor changes to better integrate with PICML.
          
        * PICML/paradigms/icons/file.bmp:
        
          New icon, created because the model element File is no longer
          in the root folder.
          
        * PICML/paradigms/icons/fileref.cmp:
        
          Modified icon to be similar to the new icon described above.

        * PICML/examples/BasicSP.mga:
        * PICML/examples/BasicSP.xme:

          Added new example to show how to view an assembly. I haven't
          added all the package related material. But those should be
          straightforward.

        * PICML/paradigms/IDML-Meta.xme:

          Made ComponenDef show it's type in instances.

        * PICML/paradigms/IDML.mga:
        * PICML/paradigms/IDML.xmp:

          Updated to reflect the above change.

        * PICML/paradigms/PICML.mga:
        * PICML/paradigms/PICML.xme:
        * PICML/paradigms/PICML.xmp:

          Next version of the paradigm. This time with some constraints.
          More need to be added. The Meta is still pseudo-stable.

        * PICML/paradigms/icons/DataType.bmp:
        * PICML/paradigms/icons/component.bmp:
        * PICML/paradigms/icons/manages.bmp:

          New icons + old icons resized so that GME doesn't stretch them
          to fit it's idea of how big an idol representing a model should
          be.

        * PICML/paradigms/icons/component.bmp:

          Made the icon more elongated, to hopefully make a better-looking
          display when used as a reference.

        * PICML/paradigms/icons/manages.bmp:

          Changed the 'component' piece of this icon to match the change
          to the icon above.

        * PICML/paradigms/IDML-Meta.xme:
        * PICML/paradigms/IDML.mga:
        * PICML/paradigms/IDML.xmp:

          Added new meta-model of Interface Definition Modeling Language
          (IDML).


        * PICML/paradigms/PICML.mga:
        * PICML/paradigms/PICML.xmp:

          Added binary mga files and XML exported paradigm so that users
          need not run the interpreter on the PICML meta-model. This file
          can just be registered using File->Register Paradigms, so that
          one can use the paradigm to make models without dealing with the
          complex steps involving aspect mapping.

        * PICML/paradigms/PICML.xme:

          Updated to reflect icons, changes in IDML and some minor changes
          in the connections.
