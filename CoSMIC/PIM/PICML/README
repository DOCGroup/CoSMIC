This directory contains the meta-model of Platform-Independent Component
Modeling Language (PICML). For more information on the meta-model and how
to use the modeling paradigm, please refer to docs/TechnicalManual.doc and
docs/UserManual.doc. This document outlines the steps that need to be done
for building the interpreter so that it can be used to build models.

Minimum Requirements
--------------------

1. Generic Modeling Environment (GME) version 3.10.13, available from
   http://www.isis.vanderbilt.edu/Projects/gme/index.html. Please note that
   when using GME 3.10.13, you will have to download BON.ZIP from
   http://www.isis.vanderbilt.edu/education/mic/BON.zip, and unzip it to
   %GME_INSTALL_ROOT%\SDK\BON.

2. Microsoft Windows (NT,2000,XP)

3. Microsoft Visual Studio VC6 SP5. Note that this release of PICML will
   not work with Microsoft Visual Studio .NET.

4. Xerces Library, version 2.5.0 or later available from
   http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/download.cgi/ for building the
   interpreter. After installation, XERCESCROOT should point to the
   installation root for Xerces. The interpreter project expects
   $(XERCESCROOT)\lib to contain the Xerces library and
   $(XERCESCROOT)\include to contain the header files. Also make sure that
   $(XERCESCROOT)\bin is in your PATH.

5. STLPort, version 4.6.0 or later, available from
   http://www.stlport.org/download.html. Builder Object Network (BON)
   version 2 needs a C++ standards compliant STL implementation like the
   one provided by STLPort. Hopefully this dependency on STLPort will be
   revisited when support for Microsoft Visual Studio .NET is added.

Installation instructions
-------------------------

1. Open GME. Click File->Import XML. Choose paradigms/PICML.xme. Click OK.
   In the next dialog box, leave "Create Project File" checked, click Next.
   Leave PICML as the File Name, and choose Open. File should have
   successfully imported.

2. Interpret the Project by clicking on the "i" button on the toolbar.
   Click OK to any dialog box that pops up including the one that asks if
   you want to register this paradigm.

3. Now you can create models using PICML.
