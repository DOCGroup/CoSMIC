This directory contains scripts for migrating existing models 
created using an earlier version of PICML to the lastest version
of PICML. Each migration script is designed to port existing 
models to that version of CoSMIC/PICML. Depending on what version
of CoSMIC you initially used to create the model will determine
how many individual transforms the model must undergo. For example,
if the model was created with version 0.0.3 and the target version
if 0.0.5, then the model must be transformed using 0.0.4.xslt and 
0.0.5.xslt. This is the only way to ensure accurate migration of
existing models.
