This document contains a list of regression test that need to
be run manually until we have the ability to automate such
testing.

. Creating an instance of a ComponentAssembly that contains one
  or more ComponentInstance elements that have ports is prevented
  due to bad logic in the PICMLManager.

. The ports a Component and ComponentInstance element do not show
  up because of a bug in the corresponding decorator.

. Use idl_to_picml to create the PICML model for the Shape example
  in the dds4ccm directory of the CIAO repo. Then use idl_to_picml
  to re-import the files for the same example into the same model
  create from the last step. Make sure the model is able to import
  into GME correctly and there are no duplicate id constraint
  violations.

. Run idl_to_picml on a directory that has E.idl (or executor
  IDL) files and verify that those files are not imported into
  the model.
